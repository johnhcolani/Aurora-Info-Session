Aurora Gallery – Slide Deck Narrative
====================================

Slide 1 — Title
- Highlight the app name, tech stack (Flutter, Clean Architecture, BLoC, Auto Route).
- Show full-screen screenshot of the RandomImageView.
- Introduce scope: interview sample project delivering adaptive gallery experience.

Slide 2 — Challenge
- Outline the brief: fetch random image, center it, adaptive background, refresh button.

- Emphasize smooth transitions, accessibility, resilient loading/error handling.

- Use annotated screenshot of the main screen.

Slide 3 — Architectural Blueprint
- Explain Clean Architecture layers (data, domain, presentation).
- Mention `RandomImageBloc` and location: `lib/features/random_image/presentation/bloc`.
- Call out navigation via `auto_route` (`app/router/app_router.dart`).
- Note code generation with `freezed` and `build_runner`.
- Include directory structure visual.

Slide 4 — Data Flow
- Walk through button press → Bloc event → use case → repository → remote data source → API → UI.
- Discuss `DataState` (`DataSuccess`/`DataFailed`) for success/failure handling.
- Mention dominant color extraction executed in isolate.
- Show flow diagram with arrows and file references.

Slide 5 — Presentation Layer Details
- Describe `RandomImageView`, `AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedSwitcher`.
- Call out custom clippers (`AppBarBumpClipper`, `TopBumpClipper`).
- Highlight glowing ellipse overlay positioned in Stack.
- Provide screenshot with call-outs.

Slide 6 — Palette & Glow Feature
- Detail dominant color extraction (`_getDominantColorFromUrl` via `compute`).
- Explain `_glowColor`, `EllipseData`, and `SingleGlowEllipsePainter`.
- Mention light/dark adjustments via `ThemeCubit`.
- Use zoomed screenshot focusing on the glowing ellipse.

Slide 7 — Error & Loading States
- Loading indicator: `_LoadingIndicator` with `SpinKitSpinningLines`.
- Error fallback: `_ErrorMessage` with friendly messaging.
- Accessibility: semantics on buttons, disabled states during loading.
- Provide two screenshots (loading, error).

Slide 8 — Tooling & Packages
- List key dependencies from `pubspec.yaml` (`flutter_bloc`, `auto_route`, `dio`, etc.).
- Mention command: `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`.
- Show snippet of `pubspec.yaml` and terminal output.

Slide 9 — Demo Narrative
- Demo script: initial load, background animation, glowing badge, pressing “Another”, theme toggle.
- Optionally showcase error state by simulating network loss.
- Embed short screen recording or sequential screenshots.

Slide 10 — Results & Next Steps
- Summarize delivered value: maintainable architecture, polished UX, responsive performance.
- Outline future enhancements: offline caching, bookmark album, analytics.
- Use checklist or roadmap visual.

Slide 11 — Q&A / Contact
- Recap strengths, invite questions.
- Share contact information (email, LinkedIn).
- Finish with app hero image or company logo.

Screenshot & Snippet Checklist
- High-res main screen (light and dark mode).
- Animated background capture or GIF.
- Glowing ellipse close-up.
- Loading and error state captures.
- Code excerpts: `RandomImageBloc._fetchImage`, `_GlowingEllipse`, route setup.

Command Recap
- `flutter pub get`
- `flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- `flutter run` (on Medium emulator)
- Golden tests: `flutter test --tags=golden`
- Widget tests: `flutter test test/widgets/`
- BLoC tests: `flutter test test/bloc/`
- Integration tests: `flutter test integration_test/`

Integration Test Scenario (Bookmark)
- Launch the app and wait for initial random image load.
- Tap the bookmark icon to navigate to the bookmark album screen.
- On the album list, tap a bookmarked image to open its detail view.
- Verify detail content, then use back navigation to return to the bookmark page.
- Confirm the bookmark list is still visible and conclude the test.
